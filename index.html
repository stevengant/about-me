    <p>Hi, my name is Steve Gant. I grew up in Edmonds, Washington and now reside in Marysville, Washington. I have kind of a diverse work history, but primarily worked in wholesale HVAC as an Inside Sales Representative. I recently quit my job at a company I worked at for almost fifteen years so I could come to Code Fellows and focus completely on learning my new chosen profession. I enjoy coding because I love problem solving and also enjoy seeing the fruits of my labor when the code works.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My short term goal with this class is to gain the knowledge and skills to start a new career. In these tumultuous times, I need a job that offers flexibilty and growth opportunity. I also intend to do some freelance work between now and my graduation date. My hope is to one day integrate my coding skills with my photography hobby.</p>
